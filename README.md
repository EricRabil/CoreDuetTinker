#  CoreDuetTinker
CoreDuet is, from what I understand, a local analytics server. It tracks everything from what song is playing to what app is in the foreground, your current location, whether you're driving, and much more.

This is a very hacked together project that I made for dumping the state of CoreDuet and learning how to subscribe to changes. No warranty is provided, and you may do as you wish with this code.
